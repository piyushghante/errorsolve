To interact with your MongoDB database named "PSG" and perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and viewing documents in a collection using the MongoDB shell on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. *Open the MongoDB Shell*:
   Open your terminal and start the MongoDB shell by typing:
   sh
   mongo
   

2. *Switch to Your Database*:
   Switch to the "PSG" database by running:
   sh
   use PSG
   

3. *Viewing Documents*:
   To view documents in a collection, use the find() method. Replace collection_name with the name of your collection:
   sh
   db.collection_name.find().pretty()
   
   - The pretty() method formats the output for readability.

4. *Inserting Documents*:
   To insert a document into a collection, use the insertOne() method. Replace collection_name with the name of your collection and adjust the document structure as needed:
   sh
   db.collection_name.insertOne({ "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" })
   
   - To insert multiple documents at once, use insertMany():
     sh
     db.collection_name.insertMany([
       { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" },
       { "key1": "value3", "key2": "value4" }
     ])
     

5. *Deleting Documents*:
   To delete documents from a collection, use the deleteOne() or deleteMany() methods. Replace collection_name with the name of your collection and adjust the query to match the documents you want to delete:
   sh
   db.collection_name.deleteOne({ "key1": "value1" })
   
   - To delete multiple documents:
     sh
     db.collection_name.deleteMany({ "key1": "value1" })
     

6. *Example*:
   Let's assume your collection name is students.

   - *Insert a document*:
     sh
     db.students.insertOne({ "name": "John Doe", "age": 22, "major": "Computer Science" })
     

   - *View documents*:
     sh
     db.students.find().pretty()
     

   - *Delete a document*:
     sh
     db.students.deleteOne({ "name": "John Doe" })
     

By following these steps, you can easily perform insertion, deletion, and viewing operations on your MongoDB collection using the MongoDB shell on your local machine.
